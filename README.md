# SimpleSteamLookup
A simple &amp; free steam profile lookup


This is a quick and small project. 

```This project is in early alpha hence some featurs are not added. It is a base system that can be used for improvements.```

The frontend displays the user's profile along with other necessary information while the backend retrieves the user's information through the unique steam identifier.
The backend leverages on steam's API to retrieve the information.
The project is modular and can be modified to include advance features to cater for specific requirements.

Please run npm-install to install the required modules.
