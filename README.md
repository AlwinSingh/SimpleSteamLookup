# SimpleSteamLookup
A simple &amp; free steam profile lookup requested by a client


This is a quick and relatively easy + small project. 

The frontend displays the user's profile along with other necessary information while the backend retrieves the user's information through the unique steam identifier.
The backend leverages on steam's API to retrieve the information.
The project is modular and can be modified to include advance features to cater for specific requirements.

Please run npm-install to install the required modules.
